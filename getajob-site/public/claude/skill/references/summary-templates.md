## Social Post Draft

### LinkedIn Version
[Professional tone, 150-200 words. Frame the job search as a journey with learnings. Mention industries explored, skills highlighted, or interesting companies discovered. End with a soft call to action inviting connections or referrals. No desperation.]

### X Version
[Concise version, under 280 characters. Punchy, professional, with relevant hashtags.]
```

Guidelines:
- Professional and forward-looking, never negative
- Focus on growth, exploration, and momentum
- Mention specific industries or skills, not specific companies applied to (unless user approves)
- Encourage engagement without begging
