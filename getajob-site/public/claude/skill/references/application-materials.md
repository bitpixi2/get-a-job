# Application Materials Guide

## Folder Structure Per Company

When the user says "let's apply to [company]", create:

```
Get a Job/Applications/[CompanyName]/
├── resume_tailored.md
├── cover_letter.md
└── followup_email.md
```

Use the company name with spaces replaced by underscores. Example: `Acme_Corp/`.

## Resume Tailoring

Read the master resume from `Get a Job/Master/resume.md`. For each application:

1. Identify the top 3-5 requirements from the job listing
2. Reorder and emphasize relevant experience to match
3. Mirror key terminology from the listing (naturally, not keyword-stuffed)
4. Quantify achievements where possible
5. Keep formatting consistent with the master
6. Add a brief "Summary" section at top tailored to this specific role
7. Note suggested changes as comments at the bottom under `<!-- CHANGES MADE: -->`

## Cover Letter Template

Use this structure as a flexible guide. Tone: professional, confident, genuine.

```
